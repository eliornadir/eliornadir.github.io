<div align="center">

My heart in pain  
My joy unseen  
I pray for answers  
To what I've been  

Comfort eludes  
So begs my soul  
Yah please guide my mind  
To your holy goal  

I miss her voice  
Her tenor rings  
So help me forget  
All of these things  

Her gorgeous smile  
Her unique love  
Her care for others  
And all thereof  

Release me from  
Remembering  
All that she is  
And that I've been
