<div align="center">

My heart in pain<br />
My joy unseen<br />
I pray for answers<br />
To what I've been<br />

Comfort eludes<br />
So begs my soul<br />
Yah please guide my mind<br />
To your holy goal<br />

I miss her voice<br />
Her tenor rings<br />
So help me forget<br />
All of these things<br />

Her gorgeous smile<br />
Her unique love<br />
Her care for others<br />
And all thereof<br />

Release me from<br />
Remembering<br />
All that she is<br />
And that I've been<br />
