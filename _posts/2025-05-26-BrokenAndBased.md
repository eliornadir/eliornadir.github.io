excerpt: "A reminder to choose the hard path of integrity over the easy path of comfort."
---
I was watching a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JNk_hmdU1Y) from [The Urban Rescue Ranch](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheUrbanRescueRanch) and he said something that really resonated with me:

> "I would rather be broken but based instead of comfortable and cringe."

I wanted to remember this every day, so I made a wallpaper to have on my phone:

I pray that if you are reading this, you won't choose the easy route. We're all presented with difficult choices, but often the right choice is the hard one. Face the difficulty.

Don't be cringe. ![](/assets/images/CringeGun.gif){:width="36px"}
