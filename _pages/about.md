If I think of something to write about myself, I will put it here.

Follow the commandments of Yahweh.

> 1. Have no other gods before Yahweh
> 2. Don't have idols
> 3. Don't use Yah's name haphazardly or say that He did something when He didn't
> 4. Keep the Sabbath
> 5. Respect your mom and dad
> 6. Don't murder
> 7. Don't be an adulterer, fornicator, or anything like that
> 8. Don't steal
> 9. Don't lie, especially when you're lying about what someone else did
> 10. Don't be really envious of what someone else has

There are more than that and the Bible is a good place to find them.
